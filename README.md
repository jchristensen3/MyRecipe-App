This is a basic Recipe Book application for users to store what ever recipes that they would like to. Users are able to create an account then they can add recipes they like and also manage those recipes by editing, or removing them. 

## Used technologies and concepts

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Many to many relationship
- Express
- Sequelize


## Goals for this project

- Express API Build an Express Application.
- RESTful Routes Design your CRUD routes using the REST.
- EJS Leverage EJS to display data.
- SQL Persist at least two models to a SQL Database. Use at least one one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between models. At least one model needs to include full CRUD functionality.
- Git 50+ commits. Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed.
- Code Style Write professional-looking code. Follow the Airbnb Javascript Styleguide.
- Visual Design Use Flexbox, CSS Grid, Bootstrap, or another CSS framework to make your front-end snazzy. First impressions matter!
- Documentation Write a README.md that would give a snapshot of your app. Screenshots are encouraged. See the example readme for a suggested structure.
